#### General

The *Advanced Functional Programming* summer school has been running
for more than ten years. We aim to educate aspiring Haskell
programmers beyond the basic material covered by many textbooks.

The lectures will cover several more advanced topics regarding the
theory and practice of Haskell programming, including topics such as:

* lambda calculus;
* monads and applicative functors;
* generalized algebraic datatypes;
* datatype generic programming;
* type families and type-level programming.

The summer school consists of a mix of lectures, labs and a busy
social program. You may want to check out the preliminary
[schedule](schedule.html) to get some idea of what to expect.

The school will run from 07 July &ndash; 11 July 2025.

We kindly ask to register **before June 1st**.

#### For whom

We expect students to have a basic familiarity with Haskell
already. You should be able to write recursive functions over
algebraic data types, such as lists and trees. There is a great deal
of online material freely available that covers this material. If
you've already started learning Haskell and are looking to take your
functional programming skills to the next level, this is the course
for you. Or if you're used to working in functional languages such as
Scala, PureScript, Elm, OCaml, or Racket, and looking to learn more
about foundations and Haskell -- you may want to consider joining our
summer school.

#### Venue

The lecture and lab sessions will be run in person in Utrecht. At the
moment, we are not planning to offer hybrid lectures or remote
attendance&mdash;but we are monitoring developments surrounding the
pandemic closely.


#### Costs

We charge a registration fee of €500 (for students) and €950 (for
professionals). There is an additional housing fee of €200 euros, if
you need accommodation in Utrecht. Note that this registration fee
includes course materials, coffee, lunches and dinners throughout the
week. If the registration fee is problematic for you *for any reason
at all*, please email the organisers and we can try to offer you a
discounted rate or a fee waiver.

#### Questions?
