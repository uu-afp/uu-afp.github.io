      <h2><a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~swier004">Wouter Swierstra</a></h2>

      <p>Wouter first learned Haskell as an undergraduate in 1999 in
      Utrecht. After completing his degree, he went on to do a PhD
      about functional programming languages at the University of
      Nottingham. After a brief stint in industry and various post-doc
      positions, he is now an assistant professor at the University of
      Utrecht.</p>

      <h2><a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~jeuri101/homepage/">Johan Jeuring</a></h2>

      <p>
      Johan wrote his first functional program in 1987, when
      still an undergraduate.  He wrote a PhD thesis on the algebra of
      programming, and went on to develop various kinds of generic
      programming approaches in Haskell, first in Gothenburg, Sweden,
      and later in Utrecht. He is now a professor of software
      technology for learning and teaching, and he uses functional
      programming techniques to develop various kinds of intelligent
      tutoring systems and serious games.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/">Manuel Chakravarty</a></h2>

      <p>Manuel used Haskell extensively during his PhD studies, and
      subsequently, contributed to both the design and implementation
      of the Haskell programming language as well as several Haskell
      tools and open source libraries, including multiple systems for
      data parallel programming of multicore CPUs and GPUs. He used to
      be an associate professor at UNSW Sydney, but now works with
      Tweag I/O as a functional programming evangelist and is the
      indie developer behind the interactive development environment
      Haskell for Mac.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~keller/">Gabriele Keller</a></h2>

      <p>
        Since writing her first functional program, an Emacs mode in
        Elisp, as a first year student, Gabriele has been fascinated
        by the concept of functional programming. Moving on to
        strongly typedl languages like Haskell, she did her PhD on
        parallel functional programming. Since then, she has been
        active in the Haskell research community and has contributed
        to a number of Haskell high-performance libraries. She has
        been teaching programming language theory and practice at
        University of New South Wales, Sydney since early 2000.
